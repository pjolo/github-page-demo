This code set additionally includes, as deprecated, format codes defined by [HL7 for some Implementation Guides](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=CDA_Format_Codes_for_IHE_XDS). The HL7 codes are now managed by HL7. The set of IHE FormatCode codes was listed in HITSP C80 Table 2-153 Format Code Value Set Definition, but since has been updated. The use of the FormatCode specifies the technical format of the document. The FormatCode tends to reference the IHE Content Profile (Implementation Guide) that defines the use-case and constraints. The FormatCode is a further specialization more detailed than the mime-type. The FormatCode provides sufficient metadata information to allow any potential document content consumer to know if it can process and/or display by identifying a document encoding, structure and template. The set of codes is intended to be preferred.","ValueSet/DocumentEntry.formatCode"
http://loinc.org,3.1.0,active,"2.16.840.1.113883.6.1",LOINC,Logical Observation Identifiers, Names and Codes (LOINC),"LOINC provides a set of universal names and ID codes for identifying laboratory and clinical test results.1,2 LOINC facilitates the exchange and pooling of results, such as blood hemoglobin, serum potassium, or vital signs, for clinical care, outcomes management, and research. LOINC's universal identifiers (names and codes) can be used in the context of order and observation exchanges between information systems that use syntax standards such as HL73, CEN TC251, ISO TC215, ASTM4, and DICOM. Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.","ValueSet/ch-vacd-laboratory-serology-vs"
